# Fun JavaScript Facts
- JavaScript was created in just 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, before being officially renamed to JavaScript.

- JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and used on over 97% of websites. It runs on many devices and every major web browser.

- Despite the name, JavaScript is not related to Java at all. The name was inspired by Java's popularity at the time.
JavaScript has primitive data types like numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols and bigints. But it doesn't have classes, so everything inherits from objects.

- The console.log() method was originally added to JavaScript as a debugging tool. Logging things to the console is still widely used.

- JavaScript has first-class functions, allowing functions to be assigned to variables, passed into other functions and returned from functions.

- Callback functions are frequently used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous actions like fetching data from an API.

- JavaScript is a single-threaded language which can cause blocking. So it relies on an event loop for asynchronous callbacks.

- The JavaScript engine in web browsers is highly optimized, making it very fast for client-side scripting.
